Intrinsic Valuation
===================

When you look at a business you the equity in the business or the entire business

You are trying to value a business based on its:
	cashflows
	growth
	risk

Its design for cashflow generating assets: Business, Stock, Young startup

================================
Discounted cash flow valuation:

The value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows on that asset
Biols down to estimating cash flows and adjusting for risk

Get the expected cash flows on an asset / business over time expected across all scenarios
This means we have to consider good and bad scenarios. Thus, we discount for risk.

Two ways to do it:

	

1.  Value of an asset =  Expected(CashFlow(1))	   Expected(CashFlow(2))    		  Expected(CashFlow(n))		n: year number
	 	 										----------------------  + ---------------------_ + ... +  ----------------------
	 											(1 + riskrate ^ (1))	     (1 + riskrate ^ (2))      	  	(1 + riskrate ^ (1))

	 	Here you take the expected cashflow with risk adjustment per year period


2.	Value of an asset =  CertaintyEquivalent(CF(1))	   CertaintyEquivalent(CF(2))    		   CertaintyEquivalent(CF(n))
	 											--------------------------  +  -------------------------- + ... +  -------------------------
	 											 (1 + riskFreeRate ^ (1))	     (1 + riskFreeRate ^ (1))              (1 + riskFreeRate ^ (1))  

	 											 	n: year


	 	Here you take the certainty equivalent cashflow with risk adjustment per year period. Certainty equivalent cashflow is
	 	whatever money you would rather take as a replacement for the expected cash flow with risk


Two Basic Propositions:

1. For an asset to have value, the expected cashflows have to be positive some time over the life of the asset

2. Assets generate cashflows early in their life will be worth more than assets that generate cashflows later.
   The latter may compensate with growth and higher cashflows
