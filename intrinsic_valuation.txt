Intrinsic Valuation
===================

When you look at a business you the equity in the business or the entire business

You are trying to value a business based on its:
	cashflows
	growth
	risk

Its design for cashflow generating assets: Business, Stock, Young startup

================================
Discounted cash flow valuation:

The value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows on that asset
Biols down to estimating cash flows and adjusting for risk

Get the expected cash flows on an asset / business over time expected across all scenarios
This means we have to consider good and bad scenarios. Thus, we discount for risk.

Two ways to do it:

	

1.  Value of an asset =  Expected(CashFlow(1))	   Expected(CashFlow(2))    		  Expected(CashFlow(n))		n: year number
	 	 										----------------------  + ---------------------_ + ... +  ----------------------
	 											(1 + riskrate ^ (1))	     (1 + riskrate ^ (2))      	  	(1 + riskrate ^ (1))

	 	Here you take the expected cashflow with risk adjustment per year period

	 	Rather than ajust the discount rate for risk you can try to adjust the cash flow for risk

2.	Value of an asset =  CertaintyEquivalent(CF(1))	   CertaintyEquivalent(CF(2))    		   CertaintyEquivalent(CF(n))
	 											--------------------------  +  -------------------------- + ... +  -------------------------
	 											 (1 + riskFreeRate ^ (1))	     (1 + riskFreeRate ^ (1))              (1 + riskFreeRate ^ (1))  

	 											 	n: year


	 	Here you take the certainty equivalent cashflow with risk adjustment per year period. Certainty equivalent cashflow is
	 	whatever money you would rather take as a replacement for the expected cash flow with risk


Two Basic Propositions:

1. For an asset to have value, the expected cashflows have to be positive some time over the life of the asset

2. Assets generate cashflows early in their life will be worth more than assets that generate cashflows later.
   The latter may compensate with growth and higher cashflows


Value a Growth Company

Tool: Accounting Balance Sheet

------------------------------
| Asset          | Liability |
------------------------------
|	assets         |	debt  	 | assets 			 = cashflows, working capital
|								 |           | growth assets = expected value from future investements
|	growth assets	 |  equity	 | debt 				 = fixed claim on cashflow, tax deductable, fixed maturity
------------------------------ equity 			 = residual claim on cashflow, significant role in management, perpetual lives

Financial Balance Sheet

-------------------------------------------
| Asset          		   	 | Liability      |
-------------------------------------------
| Assets / Growth Assets | Debt / Equity  |   Assets = investment that produce cashflows after paying debt
-------------------------------------------   Liaility = cost of rasing equity financing

I can value the equity or the entire business

equity
Discount    cash    flows    after    debt    payments    at    the    cost    of    equity

entire business
Discount    cash    flows    after    debt    payments    at    the    cost    of    capital


NEVER MIX AND MATCH CASHFLOWS
